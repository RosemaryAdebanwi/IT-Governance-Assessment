# IT Governance Assessment


 

<h2>Overview</h2>
As a GRC Expert, I conducted an IT governance assessment for a medium sized financial institution facing challenges in aligning IT with its business objectives. Using the COBIT framework, I identified gaps and provided recommendations to improve IT governance, ensuring better alignment with the organizationâ€™s strategic goals.
<br />


<h2>Steps Undertaken</h2>

- <b>Step 1: Identified Key Business Objectives of the Financial Institution</b> 
- <b>Step 2: Assessed IT Governance Using COBIT Framework</b>
- <b>Step 3: Provided Recommendations for Improving IT and Business Alignment</b>
- <b>Step 3: Provided An Outline for a Presentation to Senior Management</b>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

This structure helped in clearly communicating the findings and ensuring that the senior management team understood the importance of IT governance in achieving the institution's business objectives.
